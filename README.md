# NSDictionary-Deep-mutable-copy


This rep contains two small categories to NSArray and NSDictionary, that create a copy of
the collection in which all dictionaries and arrays are recreated as mutable if immutable,
recursively through the collection hierarchy. It includes a sample project that demonstrates
how to make a depp mutable copy of the NSUserDefaults dictionary representation.
